# silver-giggle

The idea is that we can bundle a distro to a bunch of raspberry pis and leave them plugged in and push media to a closed group.

Possible technologies/features:
  - KODI
  - some bittorrent client
  - an rss feed to publish torrents
  - a util for library maintainers to push media to tracker and rss feed
  - some batching to keep the media library to a set usage
